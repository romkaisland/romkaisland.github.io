  <p><b><u><span lang=EN-US>Note:</span></u></b><span lang=EN-US> This article is a chapter of the entire book
    known as the “Deep Book” written by Vladimir <span class=SpellE>Pyatibrat</span>.
    Many items described in this text follow from facts and thoughts introduced in
    the “Deep Book”. Therefore it is strongly suggested that you read it first before
    start using methods explained below. Unfortunately, by now this book is
    available in Russian language only and you better get a skilled Russian
    language consultant familiar with ancient Slavic culture first. </span></p>

  <p><span lang=EN-US>This system
    of correction of metabolism was finally assembled and tested by me as
    a&nbsp;whole in 1989 on my native planet Terra, and is a&nbsp;part of the
    program named &quot;<span class=SpellE>Kolybel</span>&quot;.&nbsp;This system
    of eating was intended for one time use, in order to create necessary
    conditions for transformation of the body by the “Program of the Reverse of the
    Genetic Code of the Human.”</span></p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US><br>
    The &quot;Keys&quot; were created for manual control of metabolism, but for
    100% of operation, some more conditions are needed. We need to restrict the
    human from the atmospheric nitrate; we need electro plasma bed, medications to
    block opiate receptors, intoxicating medications and more. Without turning off
    the homeostasis (dynamical equivalence of the chemical structure in the process
    of metabolism) use the &quot;Keys&quot; for 100% is impossible, because those
    conditions can be created just in the laboratory setting.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US><br>
    In our mode of life this system of eating is allowing to fight quite
    effectively for the health, long living and independence from microbiological
    complex of the Destiny. This system of eating together with <span class=SpellE>hygienical</span> procedures and antiseptics of the natural and <span class=SpellE>synthetical</span> origin is helping to correct the homeostasis. It is helping to lower the
    hormonal status of the body (reducing the influence of females on men), it is also giving the opportunity oppose effectively the immune system
    of the body. &quot;Keys&quot; are allowing to reduce the activity of the micro
    implants (mitochondria, liposome, microphages, lymphocytes)&nbsp; what is helping
    to increase the self regulation and self defense of the body on the cells
    level, promoting the regulation of brain functions instead of build in
    automation. &quot;Keys&quot; allow watching for your body and sorting out the
    defective and poisoned by enemies' groceries, by the method of trying and
    making mistakes. This system is helping to feel different additives and the
    microbiological intervention from outside by headache, processes of
    fermentation in the stomach, and by other different factors. You would not feel
    it at normal. The system is helping to get rid of the narcotic, tobacco,
    alcohol, sexual dependence and others. </span></p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US><br>
    The system was based on the account to be used by simple people with the
    regular force of power, any nationality, sex, and place of living (with some
    exceptions). The system is partially automatic, that is why it is not difficult
    to fulfill my recommendations and not to make any mistake. A little bit about
    the principle of the &quot;Keys&quot; work. The majority of the groceries on
    the planet I&nbsp;divided in 7&nbsp;groups. They are divided by the chemical
    composition, and accordingly by frequency amplitude characteristics (by the
    basics ingredients). The grocery groups divided by those characteristics are 1-
    acidic (red), basic (green), and carbohydrates (blue). So the type of product
    is corresponding to the certain color accordingly to their frequency resonance
    characteristics. For example the red color is corresponding to the acidic
    groceries, yellow-green color for basics groceries, and blue-violet color for
    carbohydrates. The full gamma of groceries by frequency is divided in seven
    frequency amplitude groups. They are defined by seven colors of the rainbow:
    red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and navy, violet. The gamma of the sounds is
    corresponding to those colors too.&nbsp; From those chemicals we can play
    a&nbsp;music your body did not hear for a&nbsp;long time. By eating groceries
    from red to violet color the amplitude is lowering and the frequency of the
    exchange process is increasing. The chemical structure of the products taking
    part in the exchange process on the cell's level is changing too. As the result
    the body is lowering the temperature, the amount of oxygen used by
    mitochondria, the amount of nitrates and different salts. (This level is kept
    automatically as optimal by following rules of eating. As a&nbsp;result of
    using&nbsp; &quot;The seven rainbow keys&quot; the body is increasing in usage
    of carbohydrates, it is increasing output of nitrates, the body is getting rid
    of microbes, viruses, chemical toxins, acids, excessive oxygen and water. The
    amount of water in the body may reduce to 30%, the body mass may reduce by 15
    kg without change in optimal volume if you reached it already. Such changes my
    friends and me felt at the beginning of 90s during experiments, when we were able
    to stop for a&nbsp;while the mechanism of restrictions: homeostasis, immunity
    and others. By now it is almost impossible to do without special methods. So,
    during cleaning your body begin to restore. You are loosing microbes and
    viruses with breathing, sweating, it is going out with urine and feces. The
    electrical activity of the brain is increasing, the retina is turning blue, the
    activity of the other body's cells is increasing, the national and sexual
    differences are deviating, and the world around you is becoming real and alive. </span></p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US><br>
    The cleaning of the body is going deep on the cells level. The cells metabolism
    is changing towards simplicity, going out from chemical mitochondrial energy
    source based on simple electrical reactions. Step by step the body is getting
    electrons and <span class=SpellE>electromagnetical</span> energy with rare
    utilization of carbohydrates for carbonate restoration (carbonate is needed for
    seizing the neutrons from outside). With maximum action of the system the
    regeneration of the body may happen (the lost hands, legs, eyes, tooth may be
    restored). This may happen with the usage of the program in full but in many
    people such things may happen even by usage the shorter version of the program.
    This system went probation on me and my friends in </span>

    Normally the human live the life from the conceiving to death moving from the
    violet color to red. On that red color the human live the biggest part of life
    and is dying in that color (what a&nbsp;good health is needed to live close to
    death all the time). I&nbsp;tried and I&nbsp;am recommending you to turn the
    biological time and aging. As I&nbsp;told you already the effectiveness of the
    &quot;keys&quot; without all the complex is not too high but even in that
    variation the system is allowing the miracle to happen. <br>
    Now I&nbsp;will tell you about the groceries that compound the colors and then
    I&nbsp;will tell you how to use them. The location of the product in the list
    is corresponding to the danger of that product for the human.<br>

    dairy products, eggs, all meat products, all fish and seafood. Example: if any
    of those products are included in salad (<span class=SpellE>mayones</span> if
    not from Soya) does not matter in a&nbsp;big or small amount -&nbsp;the salad
    is of the red color. Example -&nbsp;not east baked bread has eggs, milk
    products and that is why it belongs to the red spectrum. The apples with the
    grilled duck are of the red color too. <br>

    by the new technology it is acidified with the sheep <span class=SpellE>trichomonas</span> and their ferments. The optimal is to use the dry milk and at least <span
class=SpellE>mayones</span> made of Soya but check the ingredients first. Soya
    is the perfect product for transfer from animal food to the vegetable. Note! <span
class=GramE>Important for men thinking about giving up sex, drinking beer, and
    eating at women kitchen.</span> Do not eat too much Soya fibers. The negative
    you will feel when coming back to orange color after making the circle on the
    rainbow. Your body will become more sensitive to hormones, and different
    toxins. Soya has analogs of women hormones and they are very strong, paralyzing
    the brain function. Don't de scary and remember that the qualities of the
    products in my system are not relevant. Beer, sex and vine are more toxic then
    vodka, but sausage is less toxic then mushrooms.) <br>
    While using beer, meat, dairy products soy is harmless and very useful and
    women hormone estrogen doesn't interact with the brain. (With such feeding the
    brain is not working at all so it can not be sick). Those recommendations about
    estrogen are not useful if you are returning to the regular feeding of people
    with meat and dairy products. If you are going to continue eating in that way,
    you would not have problems with Soya, oppositely, you'll get very good
    addition to for your ration. Don't believe talks about mutant Soya (anyways you
    are eating sausages from smelly mutants or products from smelly poppy seeds,
    the bigger sin is always covering the smaller). Soya enzymes would not seem
    tasty from the beginning but they will taste great from the third attempt. They
    are very caloric and useful, and giving the feeling of fullness very fast. </span></p>

    The next are beans: all types of beans, peas (has good chemical composition and
    taste). Next in the line composite herbal proteins- nuts: peanuts, fondue,
    walnuts. In the same group is also included the coconut, cedar nuts, sunflower
    seeds. In that color also will be corn, wheat <span class=GramE>(&nbsp;original</span> Russian names “<span class=SpellE>Manka</span>”, “<span class=SpellE>Perlovka</span>”). <span class=SpellE>Perlovka</span> has a&nbsp;lot of molybdenum, that is why <span
class=GramE>don't</span> eat a&nbsp;lot, just sometimes for variety. In the
    same group is also millet, oats, rice, potato, buckwheat (very useful). Also
    different oils of the plant origin -&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>soya</span> oil,
    corn oil. Corn oil is rich in gold, its ions are very harmful for the people,
    you can use just a&nbsp;little bit if it (remember everything is in the
    relation to something -&nbsp;meat and mushrooms are more dangerous than fish,
    but fish is more dangerous than tomato or apple.) Next is coconut oil. It is
    solid, looks like the pork fat. If you'll mix it with butter, salt, water
    you'll get the substitution for sandwich butter. Next <span class=GramE>are
    olive</span>, sunflower oil. It is preferable to use oils only produced in </span>
    <st1:country-region><span
  lang=EN-US>Russia</span></st1:country-region>
    <span
lang=EN-US> (without narcotics, dies, animal
    fats, amino acids, etc. During heating low quality oils will give the animal
    smell. Good for food not pasteurized &quot;village&quot; oils. They have to be
    just good in taste with good smell. They are less harmful than others in the
    nice packages. Next are homemade vegetable juices: tomato, pumpkin. Fruit
    juices ours in big jars or homemade (without contact with hands during making).
    The easiest way if you don't have time for juices drink tea &quot;&nbsp;<span
class=SpellE>Mayskiy</span>&quot;, as well as tea from St John's <span
class=SpellE>Wort</span>, mint,&nbsp; mineral water with good reputation, long
    boiled water (&nbsp;10-15 min for destroying bacterial proteins and chemicals)
    or water from the stream. Note: almost all additives (dies, sweeteners,
    aromatizes, other chemicals are harmful. They belongs to narcotics (correctors
    of consciousness, the molecular advertising -&nbsp;they are pushing you to buy
    them). They are close to the poisoned chemicals and their components are used
    for introduction of the frequency-resonance influence on the enemy. The biggest
    part of them was especially produced for the war with </span>
    <st1:country-region><span
  lang=EN-US>Russia</span></st1:country-region>
    <span

class=GramE>&quot;&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Lyubimuy</span></span> sad&quot;
    ,&nbsp;coca- cola and other drinks contains only pure water, and not even
    always. You are thinking why I&nbsp;can not drink. If it was released into our
    country, means we can drink. I&nbsp;will answer you that people who allow all
    those poisoned drinks to come to our country are playing on the enemy's side.
    We are all sold for money, there is such a&nbsp;business in our country. My
    dear, be careful during the war. Eat only those products you are sure about.<br>

    all sorts of cabbage, tomato, sweet pepper, cucumber, zucchini, carrots and
    others. Recommended to use in small amounts radish, beats and others- they have
    a&nbsp;lot of nitrates. Don't try to get bigger vegetables- they have more
    nitrates and this is the food for <span class=SpellE>trichomonas</span>. As
    well in this color are onions, garlic, pepper, any green vegetables. On that
    color you can still use vegetable oils without restrictions; on the next color
    it is not allowed. All the berries are here too. (Avoid water melons,

    So here I&nbsp;described the main products and discussed their qualities. If

    <br>
    The system is calculated for 1-1.5 months of use (with the regular metabolism
    process). By it cleaning effect it is equivalent to 40 days of starving.
    Starving is not touching a&nbsp;lot of aspects of feeding on the cellular level
    and has other negative moments. In my work I&nbsp;am using starving as a&nbsp;radical
    source on the background of my system. I&nbsp;am recommending to start trying
    starving only after cleaning the body by my method only after orange color (on
    the fruit-vegetable cycle). You should start with 24 hours starving once in
    a&nbsp;week, then you can use dry starving up to three days (&nbsp;not longer)
    without using any liquid (&nbsp;don't worry- the amount of urine may even
    increase). </span></p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US><br>
    While using those products you should follow certain recommendations: Do not
    drink vine, beer, chemical drinks. You can drink sometimes in a&nbsp;small
    amounts homemade brandy (spirit with walnuts insides or oak), as well as vodka
    cleaned by permanganate or spirit with homemade fruit syrup. <br>
    If you are taking any complex and important for your life medications- ask your
    doctor if it is possible to reduce the dose or stop for a&nbsp;trial. If you'll
    feel pain in the chest I&nbsp;recommend <span class=GramE>&quot; <span
class=SpellE>Corvalolum</span></span>&quot; -&nbsp;the potent natural
    medication, which is relieving spasm very fast. </span></p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US><br>
    All the products -&nbsp;fruits, vegetables, and cereals should be washed in the
    solution of permanganate. I&nbsp;am recommending washing vegetables with soap,
    don't be lazy. The most important thing for ladies to know is to avoid contact
    hands with vegetables (use gloves). It will be better if you'll cook for
    yourself, then the food will have the biggest treasure for yourself, will not
    take away your force, how it is happening on the family kitchen (&nbsp;not
    visible the microbiological war). You can learn how to make simple healthy
    food. Every man who tried at least ones knows that. The main thing is to start,
    and then you'll get used. Men, release your wives from the kitchen. Cooking is
    not for women, as well as cleaning and washing. </span></p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US>Remember <b>who
    is cooking has the power!</b><br>
    <br>
    The light solution of permanganate is suitable for the fight with the infection
    in the intestine. The solution of permanganate with its active oxygen is
    helping to restore the job of intestine, to modulate the immune system. One
    glass of solution is sometimes enough to stop the upset stomach -&nbsp;diarrhea
    or bloating. Be careful- more concentrated with dark pink color it is harmful
    for your life. The next important factor for the keeping the new micro flora of
    the stomach is ASD (<span class=SpellE>Anticeptic</span> Stimulator of <span
class=SpellE>Doroxov</span>, on my page you'll find the detail instruction on
    how to use it.) For external use <span class=SpellE>Dimexid</span> is good. You
    can use it for compresses, treatment of minor cuts and wounds, bruises,
    rheumatoid pain and others according to the instruction. You can also use
    Hydrogen Peroxide and solution of hypochlorite. Here are some important advises
    for hygiene: For cleaning homes, washing dishes, floors, tables, chairs
    I&nbsp;am recommending the bleach. For fighting with fungal infections in your
    home use sulfur (burn sulfur mixed with peaces of wood). Don't forget to take
    away flowers and food. For walls in your home not to be contaminated with
    fungus spray them several times with the solution of water and white glue. They
    will become washable.<br>
    All the myth about &quot;Breathing walls&quot; will go away. You should breath!
    For the home without ghosts is enough ventilation and periodical opening
    windows (try not to believe the disinformation that walls should breathe and
    you'll feel better right away). If you don't have enough time to clean often
    rugs on the floor from parasites try to learn how to live without them. Linoleum
    chosen with taste is easy to keep clean it does not accumulate dirt.<br>

    are eating like that, so start from the second cycle. In fact system is
    starting from the second cycle. 5-10 min before food it is recommended to eat
    one teaspoonful of honey (in order to diminish the appetite completely). This
    recommendation is good to follow up to fruit cycle, then you can just eat it
    from time to time, but you can get board of honey. You should drink as less, as
    possible, and only then feel thirsty. Never drink fir the company, because you
    get used to it or because it is tasty. (Don't be surprised if starting from the
    yellow or green cycle you would not want to drink for 2-3 days). You may eat so
    many times you want in order not to feel hungry. Don't eat as a&nbsp;habit or
    because you are greedy. Watch your feelings. You may eat not being scary to
    gain the wait or to fall asleep with the fool tummy (it is not meat or dairy
    products). Just remember to eat the only food included in your cycle, the one
    you are on now. You may feel very hungry for the first 2-3 days, so, eat more,
    and then the organism will reach the balance. You may cook any meals using the
    ingredients inside the group in any combinations. As exclusion the first few
    days of the beginning the fruit cycle you may eat nuts -walnuts or pecan -they
    will help you (they are not easy metabolized and working as a&nbsp;laxative).
    The main food of the cycle must be products included in the group. As addition
    you can eat everything what will be allowed on the next cycles, but you are not
    allowed anything from the previous cycle. It will be still better not to mix.
    It will be cheaper and will work more effectively. This is very important,
    because if you will eat something you are not allowed the effect of the system
    will be lost, the frequency resonance will be ruined and you should start from
    the beginning. </span></p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US><br>
    The moment of transferring from one cycle to another will be identified
    personally. You will do that in this way: they you are using the system you are
    collecting urine in the jar for the control of the cleaning process, better
    even in two jars. So, one you are filling now, anther one is from the previous
    time, waiting for the test. The urine will sediment, will separate in different
    parts, fungal will start growing. Collecting the urine in that way you'll be
    able to analyze it by color, smell, taste (you don't have to drink it, just put
    your finger inside and then on the tong). In that way you and your body will
    realize what is happening and what you need to do. Usually for the first three
    days the urine has a&nbsp;regular color. Then it will become darker, not clear,
    will get very strong smell. The process of cleaning is going on. The urine will
    be the same or similar for 3&nbsp;to 7&nbsp;days, then it is getting lighter
    again. Once in the morning you can look in the jar and would not believe
    yourself. Urine may be like a&nbsp;tea, or like milk with a&nbsp;lot of
    sediments or without. Don't worry- the process of cleaning is going on. There
    were cases when such urine was refused to be tested, because nobody believed
    that it was really urine inside. When such microbiological test was done it was
    said that the person is dying that is why all the microbes and viruses are
    leaving the body. The chemical composition was showing all table of Mendeleyev.
    And specialists were confused what they were testing. <br>
    This is exactly the moment when you should go to the next cycle. Your body got
    out of the frequency resonance or immune system start working. After 1-2 days
    in new cycle urine will become darker again and will show the parameters of
    cleaning again, then the body is losing the process again, urine is getting
    lighter or regular. At that moment you are switching to the new cycle again and
    again from the beginning. If you don't see such changes, the color and smell of
    urine is not changing switch to the new cycle in 5-7 days, maybe the weak point
    in the control of your system is in another higher cycle and color. </span></p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US><br>
    For the good cleaning effect it is advisable to reach the 6th cycle. Everybody
    who is feeling well after the 5-th cycle and ready to go for the sixth should
    do so. There is no reason to go through the seventh cycle in the shortened
    version of the system, unless on the previous cycle you'll reach something and
    you would like to find out more about that. It is advisable to consult
    a&nbsp;doctor if you have such an opportunity. <br>
    Coming back to the regular eating is going in the reverse way, as
    a&nbsp;difference from the other systems the time to come back to the red color
    is not equal the time of entrance. You can come back to regular eating any
    time. Coming back it is better to start new cycle in the morning. Stay on each
    cycle one day (if you have more patience 2-3 days). Sometimes the cleaning on
    the reverse cycle may be even stronger. For example you finished the cycle of
    fruits and decided to stop. So, the next day eat only salads, next day
    vegetables and on the third day anything. It is not recommended to come back to
    the red color completely, but you can try and compare your dreams about meat
    with its real taste. You will feel for the first time why you were so bad all
    the time. It is better to avoid completely mushrooms, east, dairy products and
    meat. It is very dangerous. You may eat fish and other sea food for the
    proteins following <span class=SpellE>soya</span> milk or <span class=SpellE>soya</span> mayo for the complete transformation and metabolism. You can eat it not more
    than a&nbsp;few days per month and not sooner than after three to four nights
    after the full moon. <br>
    The full system were discovered and worked out in the connection to the rhythm
    of the correcting complex of the Destiny. Starting from the young moon till
    the&nbsp; full moon the microbiological influence on the human body is
    increasing, that is why making the feeding easier is better on the growing
    moon, and eat some fish is allowed after releasing the positions of micro flora
    in your body. For sure you can start the system any day, but eat protein meals
    more than a&nbsp;few days only after the full moon. It is better not to try and
    not to give the Destiny additional power other you. </span></p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US><br>
    <span class=GramE>Some more precautions.</span> During going through the system
    you may feel some exacerbations of old diseases, which should be relieved in
    1-3 days. But I&nbsp;can prove that no one who went through the system stated
    to feel worse.&nbsp; There was no case that someone did not get at least some
    relief. People with diabetes can use the simplify course: go through the
    second, the third and the fourth cycle without honey before food and with
    minimum of sweet. The system is very effective for getting out the radiation,
    because it is stored in the nitrate compounds of proteins, which are
    disintegrated with the system. The system is effective for anybody willing to
    lose some weight and cleans the organism. It is not so difficult to go through
    the system. You would not have the feeling of hunger. Some weakness may happen
    on the fifth or sixth cycle. The system has a&nbsp;positive influence on brain
    functioning, increasing feelings, the world is becoming brighter and more real,
    the thinking is more clear. You will lose the feeling of anger the psychology
    of sexually disturbed wild animal. You'll feel some ease in your body
    ,&nbsp;the life will be more interesting ,&nbsp;you'll get the understanding of
    different things and possibility to overcome diseases and death, you'll now the
    way to go. Now you have the opportunity to try and check and to see the world
    in the different way, the way I&nbsp;can see it.</span></p>
